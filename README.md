# Tracing the History of Science Diplomacy of India
## Abstract
Science Diplomacy refers to scientific collaborations among various nations to address common problems and to build constructive international partnerships/relations.
The term “Science Diplomacy” was coined near the end of the Cold War to describe the need for new strategic partnerships at the country level to promote issues of global concern, like biosafety.

Strategic relations between individuals, city-states, and countries have forever been connected here and there to Science and Technology.

It is a subcategory of “new diplomacy” and is an umbrella term for several formal or informal technical, research-based, academic, or engineering exchanges between various countries in the emerging field of global policymaking.

Even though we say it’s a part of “new diplomacy”, forms of science diplomacy have been observed quite far in history.
Transfer of paper technology through the Silk route, Combined Science Exploration throughout History  were some examples of Paper Technology in History.
