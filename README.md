# Tracing the History of Science Diplomacy of India
## Abstract
Science Diplomacy refers to scientific collaborations among various nations to address common problems and to build constructive international partnerships/relations. It is a subcategory of “new diplomacy” and is an umbrella term for several formal or informal technical, research-based, academic, or engineering exchanges between various countries in the emerging field of global policymaking.
Even though we say it’s a part of “new diplomacy,” forms of science diplomacy have been observed quite far in history. The great voyages of exploration and colonization had brought in science-based diplomacy as a form of diplomacy of influence.
In this report, we elaborated, with the help of research papers and articles, the achievements and policies drafted by India with other countries since the beginning of science diplomacy to the present.
